# rust_z80_emu

My own implementation of the Zilog Z80 processor in RUST. The goal is to develop an Amstrad 6128 emulator afterwards.

## How to run it

For now, this is an early, experimental, implementation that will be formatted as a RUST crate later.

I'll try to always keep it executable then just run it with cargo as followed:

    cargo run --release
