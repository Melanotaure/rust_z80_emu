# rust_z80_emu

My own implementation of the Zilog Z80 processor in RUST. The goal is to develop an Amstrad 6128 emulator afterwards.

## How to run it

For now, this is an early, experimental, implementation that will be formatted as a RUST crate later.

I'll try to always keep it executable then just run it with cargo as followed:

    cargo run --release

You can also run some examples:
1. Data Copy

```
    LD HL, @DATA    ;START ADDRESS OF DATA STRING
    LD DE, @BUFFER  ;START ADDRESS OF TARGET BUFFER
    LD BC, 0x0010   ;LENGTH OF DATA STRING
    LDIR            ;MOVE STRINGâ€“TRANSFER MEMORY POINTED
                    ;TO BY HL INTO MEMORY LOCATION POINTED
                    ;TO BY DE INCREMENT HL AND DE,
                    ;DECREMENT BC PROCESS UNTIL BC = 0
    @DATA:
    .db 0xDE, 0xAD, 0xBE, 0xEF, 0xDE, 0xAD, 0xBE, 0xEF
    @BUFFER:
```

```
    cargo run --release --example data_copy
```

2. Data Copy 2

```
    LD HL, @DATA        ;STARTING ADDRESS OF DATA STRING
    LD DE, @BUFFER      ;STARTING ADDRESS OF TARGET BUFFER
    LD BC, 132          ;MAXIMUM STRING LENGTH
    LD A, '$'           ;STRING DELIMITER CODE
    @LOOP:
        CP (HL)         ;COMPARE MEMORY CONTENTS WITH
                        ;DELIMITER
        JR Z, @END      ;GO TO END IF CHARACTERS EQUAL
        LDI             ;MOVE CHARACTER (HL) to (DE)
                        ;INCREMENT HL AND DE, DECREMENT BC
        JP PE, @LOOP    ;GO TO LOOP IF MORE CHARACTERS
    @END:               ;OTHERWISE, FALL THROUGH
                        ;NOTE: P/V FLAG IS USED
                        ;TO INDICATE THAT REGISTER BC WAS
                        ;DECREMENTED TO ZERO
    @DATA:
    .db 0xDE, 0xAD, 0xBE, 0xEF, 0xDE, 0xAD, 0xBE, 0xEF, '$'
    @END:
```

```
    cargo run --release --example data_copy_2
```
